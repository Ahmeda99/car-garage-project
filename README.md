# car-garage-project

For this project I used CRUD elements throughout my work. Using mongoDB and heroku to push and deploy my work. Seeing my passion for cars I created a site where people are able to post and view from a gallery of cars.

##Technologies Used
 Bootstrap, Mongodb, Node js, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Ajax, Method Override, Express.
 
##future features

I would have liked to create a user login in able to create and share comments on certain cars you may find interesting.
